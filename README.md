# CarFree-CrossRoad
java GUI Game that uses threads and semaphore methods 


CareFree Crossroad is a 4-way intersection having high traffic every day.
It is also known as the safest place for drivers because any accident is prevented
by natural forces. These forces allow only a limited number of cars to pass the
intersection. They also ensure that the first driver who comes to the intersection
passes first.
